The project is maintained by po/iw (ποιώ), a Greek university team that supports Free/Libre and Open Source Software and hardware.

Saffron was built to help Greek universities aggregate and collect news and announcements from all of their faculties and serve them via a simple, well-documented and unified API. 

The framework supports different ways of data collection, mainly API endpoints & web-scraping. It tries to ease the process of intergrating all data sources,
by abstracting data collection into a few simple and powerful functions.
